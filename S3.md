# What is S3?

This is Amazon's Simple Storage Service, which provides object storage on the cloud.

## Disaster Recovery Plan (DR)

### Example Plans

These plans are made in case of any unexpected disaster, so that there is a backup available for a web application. There are multiple ways of doing this:

#### Multiple Availability Zones

On AWS, within a region, there are multiple zones (data centres) that an application can be deployed.

#### Multiple Regions

There are multiple regions in which an application can be deployed. This DR is more expensive than the multiple availability zones method. 

#### Multiple Cloud Deployment

This is the most expensive method, as it has different cloud computing service providers as backups.

#### Hybrid Cloud

This is a mixture between a public cloud and private cloud model. 

### S3 Backup

An effective recovery plan is carried out using CRUD:

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

#### S3 Commands from EC2 Instance

- `aws s3 ls`- lists all buckets in S3 instance
- `aws s3 mb s3://bucket-name`- create a bucket
- `aws s3 cp file-name s3://bucket-name/file-name`- copying a file from EC2 instance to S3 - can do the opposite format for copying a file from S3 to EC2 instance
- `aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force`- delete a bucket

#### S3 Tasks with Python Boto3

- `sudo apt-get install python3 -y`- installing python
- `sudo apt install python3-pip`- installing pip3
- `sudo pip3 install awscli`- installing awscli with python
- `pip3 install boto3`- installing boto3
- `aws configure`- paste access key information when prompted to configure the AWS CLI

```python
# Creating a bucket
import boto3

# using s3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

# making a bucket
s3.create_bucket(Bucket='eng122_fahim', CreateBucketConfiguration={
    'LocationConstraint': 'eu-west-1'})
```

```python
# Uploading a file to a bucket
import boto3

# using s3  
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

# Upload a new file
data = open('fahim_test.jpg', 'rb')
s3.Bucket('eng122_fahim').put_object(Key='fahim_test.jpg', Body=data)
```

```python
# Downloading a file from the bucket
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.download_file('eng122_fahim', 'fahim_test.txt', 'fahim_test.txt')
```

```python
# Deleting from a bucket
import boto3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
s3.Object('eng122_fahim', 'fahim_test.txt').delete()
```

```python
# Deleting a bucket
import boto3    
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
bucket = s3.Bucket('eng122_fahim')
bucket.delete()
```

```python 
# Listing everything within the bucket
import boto3

# Let's use Amazon S3    
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

# Print out bucket names
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)
```
