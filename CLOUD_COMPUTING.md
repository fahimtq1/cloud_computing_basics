# Cloud Computing

Please see this [link](https://github.com/fahimtq1/virtualisation_basics/blob/main/PROJECT.md) for a description on the application that will be deployed in this project.

## Definition 

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet. There are two cloud computing models: the deployment model and the services model. There are three main cloud computing service providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

## Four Pillars of Cloud Computing

- Ease of use
- Robustness
- Flexibility
- Cost

## Benefits

- Scalability- easier, faster and cheaper provisions for scaling up and down 
- Server storage- service providers manage and maintain servers
- Data security- better security in the cloud and user can avoid monitoring security protocols
- Maintenance- computing systems are maintained by the service provider, therefore reducing the costs of the user

## Deployment Model 

### Public Cloud

The cloud infrastructure is available to the public over the internet and is owned by a service provider.

### Private Cloud

The cloud infrastructure is operated and owned by a single organisation.

### Hybrid Cloud

The cloud infrastructure is a mixture of both the public cloud and the private cloud. 

## Service Model 

### Infrastructe as a Service (IaaS)

This service provides users access to basic computing infrastructure (servers and storage), so virtualisation can occur. The rest of the components are managed by the user.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

The service provider provides the necessary components for a cloud-based development environment, so that developers can conduct the developing, testing and managing of an application. 

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

In this case, the service provider handles all the components of a complete cloud computing environment, including the hosting and managing of a software application.
